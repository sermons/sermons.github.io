Just kidding, you can't contact me here.  

But this little page shows you how you can write a minimalist page if you ever want to have some page without the header and all the other bulky stuff.

It's also an example of how you can easily add CSS or JavaScript files to a template.

<div id="contact-div">I should be coloured in red to show that the CSS works</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" id="contact-btn">
  Click me
</button>

<p id="googlefont-test">You can even use any <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/">Google fonts</a> you'd like to be extra fancy, like this Lobster font</p>
