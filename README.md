# Beautiful Jekyll

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple blog-aware site generator that is used for hosting [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

GitHub pages makes it extremely simple to host your own website or a website for a GitHub repository within minutes.  While it's very easy to get started with GitHub Pages, you will get very basic looking pages and basic functionality.

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to make help you create an awesome Jekyll or GitHub Page website quickly.  [Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes or look at [my personal website](http://deanattali.com) to see it in use.


Getting started is only three very simple steps so it's *literally* as easy as 1-2-3 :smile:

known bug (problem on GitHub Pages part) - if you have a project page and want a custom 404 page, you must use a custom domain.  See https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/.  This means that if you have a regular User Page you can use the 404 page from this theme, but if it's a website for a specific repository, the 404 page will not be used.

can also give googlefonts

This template was not created 100% from scratch; I've used ideas and some code snippets from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog)
